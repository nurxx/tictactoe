# tictactoe

Implement a Tic Tac Toe game against an opponent using the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.



The game starts with an empty board.

At each step:

- one player enters two numbers ([1,3]) from the keyboard, which are their move on the board;
- using the algorithm, we find our move;
- then the specific state of the game is displayed.

Finally, the program shows who won the game.



** Make the game so that you can set whether the computer or the player is first.

*** Make the algorithm optimal.
